# Saving Your Data to a CSV
Below is the code you can add to the bottom of your program to save your data to a CSV file:
```movies.to_csv('movies.csv')```


In order for this code to run successfully, you’ll need to create an empty file and name it whatever you want — making sure it has the ```.csv``` extension. I named mine ```movies.csv```, as you can see above, but feel free to name it whatever you like. Just make sure to change the code above to match it.

# ToDo 
* Scrape other data about each movie — e.g., genre, director, starring, or the summary of the movie
* Find a different website to scrape that interests you
* Grab the movie data for all 1,000 movies on that list
